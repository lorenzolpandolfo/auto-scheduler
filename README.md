# auto-scheduler
Auto-scheduler is a Google Calendar automation that I made for my dad, so he doesn't need to manually create the social media format image that contains all the available times to be scheduled.
The script check his daily schedules and create the image in the correct resolution to Instagram story or WhatsApp status. The only user allowed to run the automation is my dad, so you can't actually run it
without editing some code. You can replace the credentials.json file to yours, so it will probably work with your Google Calendar.

# Example
This example demonstrates the final result of a run. All these times are available to be scheduled, so this image is published in a social media and the customers can choose one of the available times.
