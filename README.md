# auto-scheduler
Auto-scheduler is a Google Calendar automation that I made for my dad, so he doesn't need to manually create the social media format image that contains all the available times to be scheduled.
The script check his daily schedules and create the image in the correct resolution to Instagram story or WhatsApp status.

# Example
This example demonstrates the final result of a run. All these times are available to be scheduled, so this image is published in a social media and the customers can choose one of the available times.
